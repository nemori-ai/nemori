# Performance Notes

- Baseline benchmark script (`scripts/benchmark.py`) can be executed with `--backend filesystem` or `--backend memory`.
- Initial smoke test on local machine (1 batch, 4 messages) shows runtime under one second for memory backend.
- Further detailed benchmarking and regression tracking should append results here.
