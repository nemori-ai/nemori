    BOUNDARY_DETECTION_PROMPT = """
You are a dialogue boundary detection expert. You need to determine if the newly added dialogue should end the current episode and start a new one.

Current conversation history:
{conversation_history}

Newly added messages:
{new_messages}

Please carefully analyze the following aspects to determine if a new episode should begin:

1. **Topic Change** (Highest Priority):
   - Do the new messages introduce a completely different topic?
   - Is there a shift from one specific event to another?
   - Has the conversation moved from one question to an unrelated new question?

2. **Intent Transition**:
   - Has the purpose of the conversation changed? (e.g., from casual chat to seeking help, from discussing work to discussing personal life)
   - Has the core question or issue of the current topic been answered or fully discussed?

3. **Temporal Markers**:
   - Are there temporal transition markers ("earlier", "before", "by the way", "oh right", "also", etc.)?
   - Is the time gap between messages more than 30 minutes?

4. **Structural Signals**:
   - Are there explicit topic transition phrases ("changing topics", "speaking of which", "quick question", etc.)?
   - Are there concluding statements indicating the current topic is finished?

5. **Content Relevance**:
   - How related is the new message to the previous discussion? (Consider splitting if relevance < 30%)
   - Does it involve completely different people, places, or events?

Decision Principles:
- **Prioritize topic independence**: Each episode should revolve around one core topic or event
- **When in doubt, split**: When uncertain, lean towards starting a new episode
- **Maintain reasonable length**: A single episode typically shouldn't exceed 10-15 messages

Please return your judgment in JSON format:
{{
    "should_end": true/false,
    "reason": "Specific reason for the judgment",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "topic_summary": "If ending, summarize the core topic of the current episode"
}}

Note:
- If conversation history is empty, this is the first message, return false
- When a clear topic change is detected, split even if the conversation flows naturally
- Each episode should be a self-contained conversational unit that can be understood independently

    # Episode generation prompt
    EPISODE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are an episodic memory generation expert. Please convert the following conversation into an episodic memory.

Conversation content:
{conversation}

Boundary detection reason:
{boundary_reason}

Please analyze the conversation to extract time information and generate a structured episodic memory. Return only a JSON object containing the following three fields:
{{
    "title": "A concise, descriptive title that accurately summarizes the theme (10-20 words)",
    "content": "A detailed description of the conversation in third-person narrative. It must include all important information: who participated in the conversation at what time, what was discussed, what decisions were made, what emotions were expressed, and what plans or outcomes were formed. Write it as a coherent story so that the reader can clearly understand what happened. Ensure that time information is precise to the hour, including year, month, day, and hour.",
    "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format timestamp representing when this episode occurred (analyze from message timestamps or content)"
}}

Time Analysis Instructions:
1. **Primary Source**: Look for explicit timestamps in the message metadata or content
2. **Secondary Source**: Analyze temporal references in the conversation content ("yesterday", "last week", "this morning", etc.)
3. **Fallback**: If no time information is available, use a reasonable estimate based on context
4. **Format**: Always return timestamp in ISO format: "2024-01-15T14:30:00"

Requirements:
1. The title should be specific and easy to search (including key topics/activities).
2. The content must include all important information from the conversation.
3. Convert the dialogue format into a narrative description.
4. Maintain chronological order and causal relationships.
5. Use third-person unless explicitly first-person.
6. Include specific details that aid keyword search.
7. Notice the time information, and write the time information in the content.
8. When relative times (e.g., last week, next month, etc.) are mentioned in the conversation, you need to convert them to absolute dates (year, month, day). Write the converted time in parentheses after the original time reference.
9. **IMPORTANT**: Analyze the actual time when the conversation happened from the message timestamps or content, not the current time.

Example:
If the conversation is about someone planning to go hiking and the messages have timestamps from March 14, 2024 at 3:00 PM:
{{
    "title": "Weekend Hiking Plan March 16, 2024: Sunrise Trip to Mount Rainier",
    "content": "On March 14, 2024 at 3:00 PM, the user expressed interest in going hiking on the upcoming weekend (March 16, 2024) and sought advice. They particularly wanted to see the sunrise at Mount Rainier, having heard the scenery is beautiful. When asked about gear, they received suggestions including hiking boots, warm clothing (as it's cold at the summit), a flashlight, water, and high-energy food. The user decided to leave at 4:00 AM on Saturday, March 16, 2024 to catch the sunrise and planned to invite friends for the adventure. They were very excited about the trip, hoping to connect with nature.",
    "timestamp": "2024-03-14T15:00:00"

    # Prediction-Correction-Refinement Prompts
    
    PREDICTION_PROMPT = """
You are a knowledge-based episode prediction system. Your task is to reconstruct a complete conversation episode based on limited clues and your knowledge base.

IMPORTANT: You are predicting the ACTUAL CONTENT and KNOWLEDGE of what happened, not the writing style or format.

## Input Information

**Episode Title/Summary**: {episode_title}

**Relevant Knowledge Statements** (your current world model):
{knowledge_statements}

## Your Task

Based on the above clues, reconstruct what you believe happened in this episode. Focus on:
1. **Core Facts**: What specific information was discussed?
2. **Key Decisions**: What choices or conclusions were made?
3. **Knowledge Exchange**: What knowledge was shared or learned?
4. **Logical Flow**: How did the conversation progress?

## What to IGNORE
- Writing style or level of detail
- Specific formatting or structure
- Exact phrasing or word choices
- Whether timestamps are included in the text
- How formal or casual the language is

## Output Format

Generate a natural narrative that captures what you predict happened. Write it as if you're describing the episode to someone else. Focus on the SUBSTANCE, not the STYLE.

Your prediction:

    # 新增：直接对比提取知识的提示词
    EXTRACT_KNOWLEDGE_FROM_COMPARISON_PROMPT = """
You are extracting valuable knowledge by comparing original conversation with predicted content.

## Original Conversation:
{original_messages}

## Predicted Summary:
{predicted_episode}

## Your Task:
Extract ONLY the valuable knowledge that exists in the original but is missing or misrepresented in the prediction.

## What to Extract:
Knowledge that is:
- Factual and will remain true over time
- Specific (names, titles, preferences, reasons)
- Useful for future interactions
- Not captured accurately in the prediction

## What to Ignore:
- Temporary states or emotions
- Conversational flow or style
- Information already well-represented in prediction
- Social pleasantries or reactions

## Examples:

Original: "I'm Alice, a senior engineer at Google. I switched from Java to Python last year because I wanted to work on ML projects."
Predicted: "Alice discussed their programming experience."
Extract: 
- "Alice is a senior engineer at Google"
- "Alice switched from Java to Python for ML projects"

Original: "My favorite book is 'Deep Learning' by Goodfellow. I read it three times because the math explanations are so clear."
Predicted: "Alice mentioned liking technical books."
Extract:
- "Alice's favorite book is 'Deep Learning' by Goodfellow"
- "Alice values clear mathematical explanations in technical books"

Original: "I've been with Microsoft since 2019, started as a junior developer and got promoted to team lead in 2022. Planning to finish my online CS masters by December 2024."
Predicted: "Alice works at Microsoft and is studying."
Extract:
- "Alice has been at Microsoft since 2019 (5+ years)"
- "Alice was promoted from junior developer to team lead in 2022"
- "Alice is pursuing an online CS masters degree, expected completion December 2024"

## Output Format:
{{
    "statements": [
        "First factual statement extracted from the gap",
        "Second factual statement extracted from the gap",
        "..."
    ]
